Imagine you alter a component property `export let foo` to `export let bar`, but you don't update any of the component usages. They all have errors now but you would not catch them if you only run checks on changed files.\n\n### More docs, preprocessor setup and troubleshooting\n\n[See here](/docs/README.md).\n\n### Machine-Readable Output\n\nSetting the `--output` to `machine` or `machine-verbose` will format output in a way that is easier to read\nby machines, e.g. inside CI pipelines, for code quality checks, etc.\n\nEach row corresponds to a new record. Rows are made up of columns that are separated by a\nsingle space character. The first column of every row contains a timestamp in milliseconds\nwhich can be used for monitoring purposes. The second column gives us the \"row type\", based\non which the number and types of subsequent columns may differ.\n\nThe first row is of type `START` and contains the workspace folder (wrapped in quotes).\n\n###### Example:\n\n```\n1590680325583 START \"/home/user/language-tools/packages/language-server/test/plugins/typescript/testfiles\"\n```\n\nAny number of `ERROR` or `WARNING` records may follow. Their structure is identical and depends on the output argoument.\n\nIf the argument is `machine` it will tell us the filename, the starting line and column numbers, and the error message. The filename is relative to the workspace directory. The filename and the message are both wrapped in quotes.\n\n###### Example:\n\n```\n1590680326283 ERROR \"codeactions.svelte\" 1:16 \"Cannot find module 'blubb' or its corresponding type declarations.\"\n1590680326778 WARNING \"imported-file.svelte\" 0:37 \"Component has unused export property 'prop'. If it is for external reference only, please consider using `export const prop`\"\n```\n\nIf the argument is `machine-verbose` it will tell us the filename, the starting line and column numbers, the ending line and column numbers, the error message, the code of diagnostic, the human-friendly description of the code and the human-friendly source of the diagnostic (eg. svelte/typescript). The filename is relative to the workspace directory. Each diagnostic is represented as an [ndjson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming#Newline-Delimited_JSON) line prefixed by the timestamp of the log.\n\n###### Example:\n\n```\n1590680326283 {\"type\":\"ERROR\",\"fn\":\"codeaction.svelte\",\"start\":{\"line\":1,\"character\":16},\"end\":{\"line\":1,\"character\":23},\"message\":\"Cannot find module 'blubb' or its corresponding type declarations.\",\"code\":2307,\"source\":\"js\"}\n1590680326778 {\"type\":\"WARNING\",\"filename\":\"imported-file.svelte\",\"start\":{\"line\":0,\"character\":37},\"end\":{\"line\":0,\"character\":51},\"message\":\"Component has unused export property 'prop'. If it is for external reference only, please consider using `export\nconst prop`\",\"code\":\"unused-export-let\",\"source\":\"svelte\"}\n```\n\nThe output concludes with a `COMPLETED` message that summarizes total numbers of files, errors and warnings that were encountered during the check.\n\n###### Example:\n\n```\n1590680326807 COMPLETED 20 FILES 21 ERRORS 1 WARNINGS 3 FILES_WITH_PROBLEMS\n```\n\nIf the application experiences a runtime error, this error will appear as a `FAILURE` record.\n\n###### Example:\n\n```\n1590680328921 FAILURE \"Connection
